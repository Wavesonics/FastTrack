	<string name="notification_autophagy_content">You\'re body has entered Autophagy. Old or damaged cells are now being consumed for energy.</string>

	<string name="notification_optimal_autophagy_title">Fast Stage: Optimal Autophagy</string>
	<string name="notification_optimal_autophagy_content">You\'re body has been in Autophagy for a long time now, and your cellular health is seeing great benefits.</string>

	<string name="info_dialog_fat_burn_title">Fat Burning</string>
	<string name="info_dialog_fat_burn_content">In this stage your body has exhausted your glucose reserves. Glucose is stored as glycogen for later use, in this stage, most of your stored glycogen has been broken down into glucose and consumed for energy.\n\n Now it begins to break down adipose tissue (fat) into Ketone Bodies. In addition to being able to consume glucose for energy, your body can alternatively consume ketone bodies for energy, and as glucose stores run low, your body will switch it\'s energy mode to Ketone Bodies.</string>

	<string name="info_dialog_ketosis_title">Ketosis</string>
	<string name="info_dialog_ketosis_content">In this stage your body has been breaking down fat for long enough that your body is primarily being powered by Ketone Bodies rather than Glucose.\n\nIn addition to the fat loss benefits this implies, studies have shown benefits for inflammation related illnesses, though the mechanism of action for this is currently unknown.</string>

	<string name="info_dialog_autophagy_title">Autophagy</string>
	<string name="info_dialog_autophagy_content">In this stage your body has begun to activate some more processes for harvesting energy. In addition to breaking down adipose tissue into Ketone Bodies, it has begun seeking out old or damaged cells, and consuming them for more energy.\n\nThe research on this phase is in it\'s early stages, but it appears this is an important mechanism for the body to stop problems before they start. For instance, cancer rates are lower in people who regularly enter Autophagy. Additionally, some studies have also shown lower rates of Alzheimer\'s disease.</string>

	<string name="info_dialog_bmi_title">Body Mass Index</string>
	<string name="info_dialog_bmi_content">A rough estimation of the healthy weight an average adult human should be. It is calculated simply by dividing weight by height.\n\nOften criticized for being inaccurate, it is true that there are factors that can cause it to be misleading. For instance: an extremely muscular body builder, or a very tall or very short person. These edge cases will get inaccurate results from the basic BMI calculation.\n\nBut for the majority of people this is a good enough estimate to know if you are in a healthy weight range.</string>

	<string name="info_dialog_bmr_title">Basal Metabolic Rate</string>
	<string name="info_dialog_bmr_content">This is an estimate of the number of calories your body will burn in a day while completely at rest. If all you did was lay in bed all day, this is how many calories you could eat without gaining weight.\n\nThis is a critical number for people who are dieting by restricting daily calorie intake.</string>
