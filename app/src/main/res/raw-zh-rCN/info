# 间歇性禁食

**间歇性快递** 目前是一个非常活跃的研究领域，其中一些部分已经建立起来，其他部分仍在研究之中。 因此，用一粒盐来处理所有这一切，并请参考下面链接的主要来源。

## 快速工作的方式和原因：

人们认为，在我们作为狩猎采集者的早期发展过程中，我们的饮食是发烧或饥荒。 也许一个小部落会每星期一次或更少一次造成大量死亡。 因此，我们的身体设计良好，能够最大限度地利用这种物质，并将一切可能的东西存放以后使用。

大量获得卡车将是困难的。 例如，对高糖中的浆果强迫采摘，只需要少量糖才能做出大量努力。

### 因此，我们的机构发展了两条主要能源途径：

1. **Glucose:** 碳水化合物在消费时都会分解成葡萄糖。 葡萄糖可通过细胞直接消耗能源。 然后过剩的葡萄糖作为玻璃储存在身体周围的各个地方，如肝和骨骼肌肉。 一旦您的粘液体满位，剩余的葡萄糖将变成脂肪组织。 当需要时，存储的玻璃可以分解成葡萄糖，以便被您的细胞消耗。
2. **Ketone Bodies：** 这些是通过代谢脂肪衍生出来的，细胞可以消耗它们而不是用于能量的葡萄糖。 碳水化合物或蛋白质的过多热量(\*分别细分为葡萄糖和氨基酸)将作为脂肪组织保存(_脂肪_)， 并且在需要时，可以分解成可被您的细胞用于能量的近似体体。

在狩猎者采集的日子里，我们往往会从尸体和葡萄糖中获得我们的能量。

然而，仍然存在着这种情况。 今天，在现代西方社会中，碳水化合物很容易到来，人们能够过上大部分生命，而不必依靠尸体来获取能源。

An active area of research is about what processes the body has that are only active when the body is primarily consuming ketone bodies.

## Stages of Fasting:

1. **Glucose burning:** At first your body will be consuming the glucose that is already free in your blood. You may have heard that during cardiovascular exercise it takes 20 minutes to exhaust all your glucose. For endurance athletes such as marathon runners, they are advised to consume more glucose every 20 minutes if possible. As with all the numbers here, this is a rough estimate, a good rule of thumb if you will. This will be affected by many factors: your own body, the activity you are doing, how much glucose you already had due to your diet, etc. But it's a good enough estimate so we'll go with it.
2. **Glycogen Breakdown:** As the glucose in your blood depletes, your body will replenish it by breaking down your stores of glycogen. People who follow low carb diets will have smaller glycogen stores, so this phase can vary widely. Someone with a low carb diet may complete this stage in just a few hours, while someone with a high carb diet who does not regularly exercise could take anywhere from 24 to 48 hours to exhaust their stores. Exercise during this stage will accelerate it by forcing your body to burn glucose faster.
3. **Adipose Tissue Breakdown:** As your glycogen stores begin to deplete, your body will start switching over to breaking down adipose tissue (_fat_) into ketone bodies. This is the beginning of "Fat Burning."
4. **Ketosis:** This is the first stage that appears to show more benefits than simple calorie restriction. Ketosis is the state of ketone bodies being the primary energy source in your blood. Although the mechanism of action is not yet known, this state appears to have significant benefits for inflammation and inflammation related illnesses such as gout.
5. **Autophagy:** The body has another mechanism for harvesting energy. In this stage your body will begin consuming old or damaged cells for energy. This area of research is still in its infancy, but it appears this is actually an important mechanism for the body to fix issues. Cancers are simply damaged cells that don't know when to stop dividing. If a body regularly enters autophagy, it appears that those damaged cells are broken down for energy before they have time to become a problem. Another area of research is around Alzheimer's Disease. We know the cause of Alzheimer's is a build up of plaque amyloid in the brain, so any way to prevent those build ups should prevent the disease from taking root in the first place. Autophagy may do just that, by consuming the plaque before it becomes a problem. Additionally, some places that store glycogen and adipose tissues are fine in small quantities, but become a problem when those stores are never depleted. Cirrhosis of the liver for instance can be caused by fatty deposits in the liver impeding its normal function. If you often drink alcohol and don’t otherwise follow a low-carb diet, the stored glycogen in your liver will rarely be depleted.
6. **Optimal Autophagy:** This is probably the newest area of research, so take this with a grain of salt. But when your body has been in autophagy for a long enough period of time, it appears that further “repair” systems are activated. The mechanism of action is not yet known for this. But studies have shown that DNA damage, such as the length of telomeres on the ends of your DNA are repaired, effectively reversing age related DNA damage, and lowering your biological age. It appears to not just be autophagy that triggers these systems, stressing the body in a variety of ways can trigger them. Endurance athletes may trigger these systems, which may make sense as it appears our ancestors were endurance hunters, running for hours while stalking prey.
