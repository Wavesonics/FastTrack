# Suggerimenti

Fasting can be difficult! Here are some pointers to help.

## Start slow:

- Try a couple 16 hour fasts to begin with, then move to 30 hour fasts, and so on.
- The more you fast, the easier things will get.
- When you start doing multi-day fasts, generally the first day is harder than the second day.

## Zero Calorie Foods

- **Drink lots of water:** Besides being good for you, filling up your stomach with lots of volume will help you feel full for a while.
- **Drink zero calorie beverages:**
  - Flavored seltzer waters are great for this!
  - Unsweetened Tea (_Hot or Iced_)
  - Water with Lime or Lemon juice

## Very Low Calorie Foods

You can actually eat a couple calories during your fast and still be just as effective. Try to keep it under 100 calories per day. To this end, here is a recipe I find very effective at "feeling like food" while only being about 5 calories per serving:

**Spicy Chicken Broth:**

- 1 tsp of chicken bouillon
- 8oz (1 cup) boiling water
- Dash of habanero hot sauce
- Dash of lime juice

## Appetite suppressants

- **Coffee:** more than just filling your stomach up a bit to feel full, will actively suppress your appetite for a while
- **Hot Sauce:** Usually these are zero calories, and will also help stave off feelings of hunger
