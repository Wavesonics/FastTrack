# Project Guidelines

This is an app used to track intermittent fasting. It is not a medical app, but really just
apply some rule-of-thumb calculations to guestimate what stage of fasting a user is in.

It's all about providing motivation when fasting gets hard. So we provide lots of extra
info and tools to the users as well.

For the code, we want to follow the latest guidelines, and libraries.
Jetpack Navigation 3 and Material Design 3 in particular.

* It's just a normal Android app structure currently
* We're in the process of updating it to be very modern, switching from Viewsto Compose and using the latest libraries
