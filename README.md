Intermittent fasting has many benefits! But it can be very hard to stay motivated during a fast.

This is a simple FOSS app intended to help keep you motivated. It is not a medical app and does not provide medical
advice.

This uses a "rule-of-thumb" quality model for determining what fasting stage you are currently in. It has been somewhat
validated through real world testing using a ketone breath meter, as well as reading medical studies on the matter, but
even still, it is just a rule-of-thumb. There are many things that would affect what stage you are in on this particular
fast.

## Privacy

We don't collect any data whatsoever. The app doesn't even have the INTERNET permission. The app operates entirely
locally.

## Development

FastTrack is not in active development; however, I will fix bugs if they are reported. If you have some neat feature
you'd like to contribute, open an issue to discuss it.

See [docs](docs/HOW-TO-RELEASE.md) on how to publish a new release.
